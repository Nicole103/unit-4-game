# The Crystal Collector Game

## Overview
The Crystal Collector Game uses JavaScript to select the random number for the user to match by clicking on the crystals. Each crystal is assigned a specific value for each turn. These string values were then changed to number values by using parseInt method so that the current total could be calulated. Once the user either reached a true equal value or exceded the value of the random number the game would declair the turn won or lost.
